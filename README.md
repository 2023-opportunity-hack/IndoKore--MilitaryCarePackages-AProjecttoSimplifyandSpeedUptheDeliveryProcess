## Introduction
Being able to give back to the incredible family that has been protecting our country is a wonderful thing to do. Blue Star Mothers of Maricopa AZ 7 is a non-profit organization that has been sending care packages to deployed military members. Behind the incredible work they have done, Blue Star has been facing several difficulties that could limit and impact the kindness that they want to spread, and that is why we have come up with solutions to their problems.

We created two different web apps for Blue Star and the customer. 

Blue Star web app: https://blue-star.web.app/ 

Customer web app: https://blue-star-mothers.web.app/

## Challenges
- Tight timeline - The hackathon format meant all development had to be completed very quickly, which limited the overall scope and resulted in taking some shortcuts.
- Learning new technologies - Some team members had to learn new frameworks like React and Firebase on the fly during the project. The initial learning curve reduced productivity.
- Scope creep - Adding too many features resulted in some half-finished functionality rather than polished core features. Better scoping would have helped.
- Complex workflows - Some processes like inventory management and shipping had complex workflows that were difficult to fully implement within the timeline.
- Styling debt - Focus on functionality left styling and polish until late, resulting in inconsistent UI.
- Technical debt - Tight deadline led to cutting some corners in code quality that need to be paid down.
- Feature creep - Ideas for new features kept getting added late into development, stretching our resources.

## Future Enchacements
Incorporate additional shipping carrier integrations beyond USPS
Develop a mobile app version of the interface using React Native
Add user roles and permissions to restrict access to certain app features
Enable photo upload for inventory items and shipments
Build out customer profiles with order history and user settings
